Name: Chenyang Li



In the final project, my own task is that I use drawpixel() function to draw the map and 4 boxes in it.

I also use drawstring() function to draw all 45 beans in the map and figure out all the beans' positions.

Then my partner and I together figure out how to win the game.

challenges:
When I draw the 4 boxes, I have to figure out the total map and draw each line independently. I have to 
make the path so the eater can pass between the boxes.
The most difficult thing to me and my partner is to figure out how to win the game.

Do differently:
If we have more time, we can make several animals in the map and when the eater meets the animals, the eater
will die and game over.
