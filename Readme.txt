Our game is named Eating-beans. At the beginning of the game, we initial the location of the eater,
at the top left on the led-screen. Then we use nunchunk to control the eater's location. We can use
nunchunk to make eater go up, down, left and right. There are 45 beans in the map. When our eater has
eaten all of 45 beans, we can win the game.  There are also 4 boxes in the map as the bound. The eater
cannot go beyound the bound. We also make an outer bound in the map which is 128 * 160 rectangle.

Task of Chenyang:

1. Draw the box and outer bound at the beginning of the game.

2. Draw the beans and use drawstring() to draw the eater

Task of Ke Zhao:

3. Make the bound between the 4 boxes in the map

4. Use the drawstring() to re-draw the black color so that the eater can eat beans.

Task of both people:

5. We together figure out how to win the game, which is that after the eater eats all the 45 beans, we win the game.

6. We together figure out how to add audio to the game. We can play the audio the game at the beginning of the game 
and then we play the game.
